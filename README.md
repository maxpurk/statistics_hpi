# Data Science Project on Stress and Rest Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to stress and rest conditions. We use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and others to load, process, visualize, and perform statistical analysis on the data.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Usage

The project consists of several Python scripts that perform different tasks:

Data Loading: Importing data from CSV files.
Data Processing: Calculating magnitudes, slicing data, and preparing it for analysis.
Data Visualization: Generating various plots to visualize the data before and after processing.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests and computing descriptive statistics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of measurements under two conditions: rest and stress. The data is stored in CSV files within the 'Raw_Data' directory.

## Output

The scripts generate various visualizations and statistical summaries. These include histograms, box plots, strip plots, and descriptive statistics.
