Basic idea:

Examine the difference in the data of acceleration sensors of a phone lying on the chest after (1) rest and (2) movement

Experiment 1:

Describtion of the setting

i) Position of the phone:
- Display to the ceiling
- Top part of the phone aiming to the chin in the direction of the body length
- Wearing on layer of thin clothes
- Position on the sternum between the mamilla
- lying on ever floor

ii) Recording data
- Press start 
- Get in the position (seconds)
- hold your breath for 10 seconds (count on your own)
- stop recording
-> For further anaysis we check for complete data, cut the first 3 s and up to second 8

Slicing later on 

(1) Rest Recording:
- No other recording in the last 3 minutes 
- Stand for at least 30 seconds just resting
- Go on with ii)

(2) Movement Recording
- No other recording in the last 3 minutes 
- Do 10 Burpees 
- Directly go on with ii)


iii) Technical specifications
    - Device independent
    - App: Phyphox
    - Sensor: Acceleration with g
    - Extract as CSV (Comma, decimal point)
