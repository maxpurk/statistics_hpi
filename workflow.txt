0. Collect Ideas
    + Examine the power of the acceleration sensors of the phone of differentiating between different levels of physical stress
    + First of all: keep it simple:
        Compare rest(0) vs. 10-Burpees (1)
        Defining an SOP for Data Gathering


1. Feasibility study + Technical Workflow
    Experiences:


    Environment:
    - Using Gitlab for colaborating
    - Using Python due to experience (both of us and Justin) and powerfull tools
    - Choose an App (?) 
    - Collect Data using guidance by SOP
    - Preprocessing with pandas, numpy, (?)
    - Visualization with Matplotlib + seaborn
    - Statistical test



2. Define the Study question + sample size calculation
    Q1:
        H0: There is no difference in our calculated score based on the sensor data between group rest and stress.
        H1: The score is greater for the stress group (1) compared to the rest group (0).

    Choosing appropriate test (check the distribution ->  parametric / non-parametric)

    Estimating effect size:

    alpha = 0.05

    beta = 1 - Power = 0.2

    Calculating the sample size based on a Pearson Correlation = 0.5  (Cohen`s D = 0.5):
    
    Based on alpha beta and Pearson Correlation = 

    




3. Gathering the data
    3.a) Physical workflow
        - see SOP_Collect_Data.docx

    3.b) Saving as XXY.csv XX = PersonID , Y= 0 : Rest, Y = 1: Stress ( after 10 Burpees)

    3.b) Data Visualitation



4. Preprocessing / Cleaning
    a) Cleaning and cutting
    b) dealing with outliners
    c) Feature Extraction 
        - Calculating the Magnitude
    

5. Analyzing
